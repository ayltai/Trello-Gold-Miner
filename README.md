# Trello Gold Miner
Give you a taste of Trello Gold

## What is Trello Gold Miner?
Trello Gold Miner is a Chrome extension that unlocks Trello Gold features for Trello (non-Gold) users. **Note that any changes made to unlocked features cannot be persisted on Trello server.** That is, your Trello settings will be restored to its original Trello, non-Gold, state if you hit Refresh or open Trello in a new tab. You will get HTTP 401 or 409 when you made those changes. Yet you can still treat them a trial.

## Unlocked Trello Gold features
- Change Background: Photos, Patterns and Textures, Custom
- Power-Ups: Unlimited
- Stickers: Taco Pack, Pete the Computer, Custom Stickers
